# ChocAn Data Processing System

A simplified data processing system developed for Chocoholics Anonymous (ChocAn), designed by **Team Whitespace** as part of the CS314 Software Engineering course at Portland State University.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world service management system that allows ChocAn providers and managers to:

- Validate members
- Log services provided
- View the provider directory
- Generate weekly reports for members, providers, and management

The system uses a **terminal-based interface** and integrates with an **SQLite-backed database** for secure and persistent data storage.
